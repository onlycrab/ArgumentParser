<pre><span class="s1"><b>ArgParser</b> is one more java command-line argument parser library.
There are many libraries that perform basically the same functions.
For my small java projects, I wanted to write my own simple parser.
Over time, this project has acquired some additional functionality.
So I decided to add a demo and publish it.
I will be very happy if this is useful to someone!

For a more detailed description of the project see the project page at github
